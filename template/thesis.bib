	abstract = {Nowadays, Fusion Energy is one of the most important sources under study. During the last years, different designs of fusion reactors were considered. At the MIT, an innovative design was created: ARC, the Affordable Robust Compact reactor. It takes advantage of the innovative aspects of recent progress in fusion technology, such as high temperature superconductors, that permit to decrease the dimensions of the machine, reaching at the same time high magnetic fields. Our main goal is the low-activation analysis of possible structural materials for the vacuum vessel, which is designed as a single-piece placed between the first-wall and the tank that contains the breeding blanket. Due to its position, the vacuum vessel is subject to high neutron flux, which can activate it and cause the reduction of the component lifetime and decommissioning problems. The activation analysis was done also for the liquid breeder FLiBe, compared with Lithium-Lead. Codes used for the low-activation analysis were MCNP and FISPACT-II. The first one is based on a neutronics model and for each component a certain neutron flux is evaluated. For FISPACT-II, the main input is the composition of the analyzed material, the neutron flux and the irradiation time. Results from FISPACT-II are the time behavior of specific activity, contact dose rate. To assess suitable structural materials for the vacuum vessel, low-activation properties were considered. Vanadium alloys turn out to be one of the best alternatives to the present material, Inconel-718. Finally, isotopic tailoring and elemental substitution methods were applied. Here, the composition of each alloy is analyzed and critical isotopes or elements are eliminated or reduced. After the modifications, new simulations are done, and those leading to significant improvements in the final results are highlighted.},

	abstract = {In Europe, the DEMO test facility for Breeding Blankets (BB) will be the next step for fusion energy after ITER. The BB is a key component facing the plasma and ensuring tritium self-sufficiency, shielding against neutrons and heat extraction for electricity production. Within the EU research program, the two concepts candidates as driver BB in DEMO consider high-pressure coolants (water or helium) and Lithium-Lead or Beryllium pebble beds as breeder. In this article, an advanced BB concept is propounded as a candidate to be tested in DEMO taking into account Molten Salt (MS) as breeder and coolant and, consequently, named Breeder and Coolant Molten Salt (BCMS) BB. BCMS BB have several advantages, which lead to their investigations. As the MS is not pressurized during operation, high requirements associated to Nuclear Pressure Equipment (ESPN / PED) could be relaxed. Furthermore, the MS magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow is low due to its weak electrical conductivity. Besides, MS BB have identified drawbacks such as the structural material compatibility and the MS chemistry control needed during irradiation. A bibliographic review of MS and compatible materials is conducted. Promising BCMS BB are analysed regarding the Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) to test the capability of such MS breeders to reach the targeted TBR. The main nuclear quantities are evaluated with various MS on a dedicated model via the TRIPOLI-4® Monte-Carlo code: TBR, nuclear heating, neutron flux, displacement damage and helium production are reported and discussed. Moreover, the thermal and thermo-hydraulic responses of the MS BB are evaluated regarding the pressure drops (ΔP), the Pumping Power (PP) and the maximum temperatures in the structures. Nonetheless, preliminary design options are investigated. Finally, the major purpose is to evaluate the feasibility of a BCMS BB and identify their advantages and drawbacks.},

Results of investigations in the areas of design, neutroncs, magneto-hydrodynamics, thermo-mechanics, ancillary loop systems, and safety are reported. Based on recent progress, it can be concluded that the boundary conditions of a DEMO-reactor can be met, tritium self-sufficiency can be obtained without using beryllium as an additional neutron multiplier, and tritium inventory and permeation are acceptably low. However, to completely judge the feasibility of the proposed concept, further studies are necessary to obtain a better understanding of the magneto-hydrodynamic phenomena and their effects on the thermal-hydraulic performance of a fusion reactor blanket.},

When needed, the value of Q(D, T) is considered to be of the order of that calculated by Marx and by Kuo-Petravic, Petravic and Watson. The systems are compared at different assumed plasma temperatures in the range 200 to 1000 keV on the basis of several criteria: the investment costs in dollars per kilowatt, the ratio of waste power to power output, and the tritium and neutron production. We have concluded, based on the estimates of the ratio of Q-values, that subject to these criteria the D-T system appears the more favoured system. On the other hand, should a means be found to enhance the Q-values the D-3He system would be preferred on all but the first criteria. We consider the three-component D-T-3He system and its optimization. Finally, the possibility of further enhancing the D-T system by utilization of tritium breeding in the plasma is discussed.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2310.00220},
	abstract = {The mass of stars is enough to confine a plasma to fuse light atoms, but this is not possible to engineer on Earth. Fortunately, nuclear engineering can rely on the magnetic confinement of a plasma using superconducting coils so long as the Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) is optimized. This paper will investigate some of the materials which can increase the rate at which Tritium is produced within the breeding blanket layer of Submersion Tokamak reactors, a design that uses magnetic confinement of a plasma in the shape of a torus to execute nuclear fusion. Using the Paramak Python module to model several geometries and OpenMC to run a simulation, it can be observed how neutron multipliers, enrichment, and the neutron energy spectrum affect TBR. This experiment will mainly observe different material choices that have been considered and their TBR based on their cross sections, dose rate, thermal properties and safety. By altering the neutron energy spectrum to account for DD and DT plasma, the difference in these compounds' Tritium breeding efficacy is noted. Neutron energy spectra are an important factor in optimising the TBR levels as the neutrons generated by the fusion reactions in the plasma interact with the breeder material in the blanket and produce tritium through the reaction with Lithium. Since Tritium is a rare isotope of hydrogen that is used as fuel in fusion reactions and has a short half-life, it is essential to produce tritium within the fusion reactor itself. Without the tritium breeding capability, it would not be feasible to generate energy via fusion. A TBR greater than unity indicates that the reactor can generate more tritium than it consumes, ensuring self-sufficiency in the tritium inventory. Since Tritium is the most reliable and efficient fuel for these reactors, optimising the TBR is of paramount importance in the long road to commercialization of nuclear fusion.},

The natural tritium is produced by nuclear reactions of neutron with N and O in the upper atmosphere, the production rate changes with 11-year cycle of the solar activity. The production and radioactive decay of natural tritium is balanced on the whole earth, results in the inventory of about 1 EBq. Anthropogenic tritium by nuclear weapons testing had been released in 1950s–1960s, at highest intensity just before the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963, and the total release would be 186 EBq. In accordance with a peaceful use of nuclear energy, tritium has been releasing to the environment as airborne and liquid effluents from nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel reprocessing plants. The release from the nuclear power plants depends on the reactor type. Other sources are the tritium production facility of military purpose and the consumer products that use tritium as luminescent energy and disposed to landfill site. Internal dose is only concerned on tritium due to low decay energy, suggesting tritium concentrations in drinking water and food are critical for dose evaluation.},

              The limited tritium resources available for the first fusion power plants (FPPs) make fuel self-sufficiency and tritium inventory minimization leading issues in FPP design. This work builds on the model proposed by Abdou
              et al
              (2020
              Nucl. Fusion
              61
              013001), which analyzed the fuel cycle (FC) of a DEMOnstration nuclear FPP-class FPP with a time-dependent system-level model. Here, we use a modified version of their model to analyze the FC of an Affordable, Robust, Compact (ARC)-class tokamak and two versions of a Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP)-class tokamak. The ARC-class tokamak breeds tritium in a 2LiF + BeF
              2
              liquid immersion blanket, while the STEP-class tokamak breeds tritium utilizing either a liquid-lithium blanket design or an encapsulated breeding blanket. A time-dependent system-level model is developed in Matlab Simulink
              ®
              to simulate the evolution of tritium flows and tritium inventories in the FC. The main goals of this work are to assess tritium self-sufficiency of the ARC- and STEP-class designs and to determine quantitative design requirements that can be used to analyze the adequacy of a proposed FC system. These design requirements are aimed at achieving a low tritium inventory doubling time (






                    t

                      r




              ) as low as possible. We also consider how improvements in FC technology and POs affect TBR

              and






                    I

	abstract = {Ensuring tritium fuel self-sufficiency while maintaining continuous and high-specification fuel flow to the tokamak via a low tritium inventory and controllable fuel cycle is a significant challenge to the STEP plant design. Effective and high-quality fuelling and exhaust design is required to sustain and control a stable plasma, whereas fuel sufficiency is required to prevent depletion of available tritium supply. Concerns regarding the lack of tritium availability preventing continuous tritium import are countered by breeding, where highly energetic neutrons from the core fusion reactions interact with lithium atoms suspended in the surrounding breeder blanket to produce tritium. The compact nature of STEP prohibits the integration of inboard breeder blankets posing a significant challenge for the design team looking to ensure more tritium is bred and made available than consumed within the core plasma. This paper outlines how purposeful technology selection and system architecting has converged on the outline of a conceivable and tritium-capable fuel cycle and breeder blanket design. Before introducing the STEP fuel cycle design outline and summarizing the approach undertaken to address the challenges facing plasma fuelling, key aspects of fuel self-sufficiency are discussed. This includes discussing a proposed helium-cooled liquid lithium breeder blanket and possible technology options for tritium extraction from lithium. Lastly, there is a brief process modelling overview, which emphasizes the central contribution of various employed modelling methods. Reflections on the presented fuel cycle design outline conclude that substantial development work is still required to realize a continuous tritium fuel cycle design and overcome the major challenges posed by tritium and lithium handling. Reflections on the presented breeder blanket design proposal conclude that while many substantial risks and blockers remain to achieve fuel self-sufficiency, high breeding ratios are expected to be achievable with a compact spherical tokamak configuration. Nonetheless, it is recognized that further consideration is required to ensure that the selection of liquid lithium as a breeder medium provides the overall simplest route to a self-sufficient and realizable design.

              In the pursuit of fusion power, achieving tritium self-sufficiency stands as a pivotal challenge. Tritium breeding within molten salts is a critical aspect of next-generation fusion reactors, yet experimental measurements of Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) have remained elusive. Here we present the results of the Build A Better Yield blanket experiment, which represents a pioneering effort in tritium research by utilizing high-energy (14 MeV) neutron irradiation of molten salts, a departure from conventional low-energy neutron approaches. Using a small-scale (100 ml) molten salt tritium breeding setup, we not only simulated, but also directly measured a TBR (

              ). This innovative approach provides crucial experimental validation, offering insights unattainable through simulation alone. Moreover, our findings reveal a surprising outcome: tritium was predominantly collected as HT, contrary to the expected TF. This underscores the complexity of tritium behavior in molten salts, highlighting the need for further investigation. This work lays the foundation for a more sophisticated experimental setup, including increasing the volume of the breeder, enhancing neutron detection, and refining tritium collection systems. Such improvements are crucial for advancing our understanding of fusion reactor feasibility and paving the way for future experiments.},

	abstract = {The Blanket Comparison Selection Study (BCSS) (Abdou et al., 1983) was one of the first most comprehensive, systematic studies offering a complete compilation of promising breeding blanket concepts. These were identified according to their combination of coolant, structural steel, and functional materials. During the time of the early 1980s, most of the ceramic breeder concepts were relying on Li2O or ternary lithium oxide compounds with a neutron multiplier arranged in a breeder zone inside a structural box that is actively and separately cooled by a coolant, which was in most of cases water, helium, or a molten salt. In the case of Li2O or ternary oxide ceramic with high at. \% Li content (e.g., Li8PbO6 and Li8ZrO6), the tritium breeding performance could be high enough to avoid the use of an additional multiplier. The form of the ceramic breeder was initially considered as pellets, arranged in stack assemblies. During the 1990s, the demonstration (DEMO) conceptual study (Proust et al., 1993) and later the EFDA Power Plant Conceptual Study (Maisonnier et al., 2007) performed a similar study, limiting the solid breeder concepts to two versions of a helium cooled: the breeder in tube (BIT) and the breeder out of tube (BOT) designs. While the former considered the ceramic breeder pellet assemblies as in the BCSS (Abdou et al., 1983), the latter introduced the concept of a ceramic breeder in the form of pebble beds. Since then, the pebble bed configuration has been widely adopted in solid breeder concepts worldwide, regardless of the coolant choice. As for the choice of the type of ceramic breeder, a relatively large palette of compounds has been identified (Hernández and Pereslavtsev, 2018), but Li2TiO3, Li4SiO4, or a two-phase mixture of both are normally the ones chosen for the designs (Zhou et al., 2023).},

            There is no doubt about the interest of achieving as fast as possible the capability to build and operate high performance reactors that finally allow fusion competing in the electricity market. An advanced breeding blanket based on the Dual Coolant Lithium Lead concept with single module segment architecture, designed for the European DEMO, is certainly aligned with such objective. This work describes some recent outcomes of the efforts carried out in the framework of the Prospective R\&D Work Package in EUROfusion to develop this line. The evolution of the design has been guided by strategies aimed to achieve an equilibrium between tritium breeding \& shielding requirements and mechanical integrity. To enhance the thermodynamic cycle efficiency and reduce the recirculation power by minimizing pressure losses in both the breeding zone and the first wall have been complementary guidelines. Specific models have been created to characterize phenomena like heat transfer and tritium permeation in the breeder channels. The experimental activities, which in general have produced promising results, have consisted in the characterization of different ceramic materials (carbides and oxides) in terms of functional properties at high temperature (as-received and irradiated/implanted samples) and compatibility with PbLi.},

	abstract = {During the conceptual design process of fusion reactors it is useful to rapidly prototype different design concepts and assess their suitability against a range of high level requirements. Rapid prototyping allows the 'fail early' mantra of other fields to be applied to engineering design.
            Furthermore, the rapid generation of low fidelity analysis allows fast exploration of design space, which enables better decisions to be made during concept selection and the detailed design phase. The Paramak is an open-source tool that aims to provide automated parameter driven 3D CAD models for fusion reactor components and magnetic fusion reactors. The geometry produced is compatible with several analysis workflows and this allows iterative automated model building and analysis to help steer the design concept optimisation process. The Paramak uses CadQuery 2 to create the 3D CAD model. The Paramak framework is used to create a few example reactor configurations including: a spherical reactor, a regular large radius tokamak and a compact submersion tank reactor. Input parameters for the various reactors that the Paramak can generate generally fall into three categories: continuous ranges such as blanket thickness, integer ranges such as number of toroidal field coils and categorical parameters such as type of divertor. The Paramak facilitates parameter studies where users can investigate the impact of input design parameters on the reactor performance. The use of modern software practices allows the geometry to be continuously tested in analysis workflows to ensure it is fit for purpose. The generation of output metrics from input parameters lends itself to the use of data science and machine learning approaches in order to steer the design. The Paramak provides rapid construction of analysis ready CAD in a manner that allows the designer to save time when exploring the design space for design studies and facilitate automated generative design.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The affordable, robust, compact (ARC) reactor is a tokamak fusion reactor concept currently under development by Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There are three important neutronics considerations for the operation of the ARC reactor: (1) breeding of enough tritium in the blanket to sustain the D–T reaction in the plasma; (2) ensuring low fluence on the superconducting toroidal field coils; and (3) assessing neutron volumetric heating in structural components. This work aims to perform a validation of the neutronics analysis approach by code-to-code comparison. State-of-the-art software stacks are employed for the neutronics analysis of the ARC reactor, and a computer-aided design (CAD) model is used directly for Monte Carlo (MC) neutron transport calculations. Three software stacks, Attila-MCNP, OpenMC-DAGMC, and Shift-DAGMC, are used to perform neutronic analyses of a 90° sector CAD model of the ARC reactor. Results show that the flux tallies calculated by the three software stacks are very close. Also, the volumetric heating and tritium breeding values have less than 0.6\% relative difference between codes.},

Three reflectors were compared, namely: graphite, beryllium and heavy water. The average cost of reactivity revealed to be minimum for graphite (maximum value of 3.92 US$/mk), while the second cheapest reflector resulted to be beryllium up to the price of 650 US$/kg. Heavy water can compete with beryllium only for higher prices of beryllium. The best reflector for MNSRs results to be graphite from the economy and safety points of view.}

This has been defined to take into account the input from the DEMO pre-conceptual design activities, the findings and recommendations of a thorough technical and programmatic assessment of the breeding blanket and the EU ITER Test Blanket Module (TBM) programs, conducted in 2017 by an independent expert panel. This work has led to the identification of (i) the most mature and technically sound breeding blanket concepts to be used as “driver” and “advanced” breeding blankets in DEMO, the latter to be installed and tested in a limited number of properly designed segments, potentially being more attractive for future fusion power plants; (ii) the remaining technical gaps and R&D priorities. A number of urgent steps that are required to better align and strengthen the EU TBM and DEMO Breeding Blanket Program as a whole and to aim at an efficient implementation of the work are described in this paper. These include a proposal to change the EU TBM options to be tested in ITER in order to obtain important and useful information from the two current breeders (solid and liquid) and coolants (helium and water) considered for DEMO.}

But it also incorporates new functional needs – financial, administrative, and procurement – and ties in the needs of future users during operation. Since the bulk of the procurement for ITER will be provided in kind, efforts have been strengthened to define better the share of responsibilities with the Parties’ Domestic Agencies. The procurement cost sharing is being transferred into realistic technical splitting of the work, with agreements between the Parties to demonstrate production of the necessary quality, and how to handle any shortcomings. The design has evolved since originally conceived and valued 5 years ago. Design reviews of specific procurements will therefore start in September 2006 to ensure the current manufacturing and design assumptions continue to satisfy requirements. This paper reviews the current status of development of the ITER project, covering organisational and technical issues.}

    abstract = { Fusion power could be one of very few sustainable options to replace fossil fuels as the world's primary energy source. Fusion offers the potential of predictable, safe power with no carbon emissions and fuel sources lasting for millions of years. However, it is notoriously difficult to achieve in a controlled, steady-state fashion. The most promising path is via magnetic confinement in a device called a tokamak. A magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) power plant requires many different science, technology and engineering challenges to be met simultaneously. This requires an integrated approach from the outset; advances are needed in individual areas but these only bring fusion electricity closer if the other challenges are resolved in harmony. The UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has developed a wide range of skills to address many of the challenges and hosts the JET device, presently the only MCF facility capable of operating with both the fusion fuels, deuterium and tritium. Recently, several major new UKAEA facilities have been funded and some have started operation, notably a new spherical tokamak (MAST Upgrade), a major robotics facility (RACE), and a materials research facility (MRF). Most recently, work has started on Hydrogen-3 Advanced Technology (H3AT) for tritium technology and a group of Fusion Technology Facilities. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Fusion energy using tokamaks: can development be accelerated?’ }

Our starting point is based on what we have learned and will continue to learn from publicly funded research on STs. Keeping prototype ST devices and HTS magnets small has enabled rapid innovation toward a commercial goal. Our ST40 compact, high field ST has proven exceptional performance, with plasma ion temperatures over 100 × 106 °C (above 8 keV) and a record triple product for any private company (n T τE ∼ 1019 keV s/m3). Meanwhile, our robust, compact, quench-safe, HTS magnets can routinely achieve over 24 T. We now have results of great interest to fusion scientists, so as well as pursuing our commercial goals, we are contributing to scientific progress in fusion. Opportunities to participate in public–private partnerships are emerging with Tokamak Energy already selected for the U.S. Department of Energy milestone program and well-positioned to participate in the U.K. Government Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production program. Other countries are likely to adopt similar approaches as the need for rapid development of fusion energy becomes ever more apparent.}",

The fast neutron spectrum produced by this system could be able to burn actinides from the spent nuclear fuel. Unfortunately, current fusion devices are unable to provide an adequate neutron yield with reasonable spending of energy. However, it is possible to design the subcritical set to multiply considerably the neutron flux by using the so-called multiplying cascades. In addition, given its simplicity, the Dense Plasma Focus (DPF) is an interesting candidate as a neutron source. In this work, we analyze a concept of a metallic-fuel hybrid reactor based on a subcritical set and driven by a DPF as a neutron source. Their spectra are evaluated to determine if they are compatible with the operation of a fast reactor. The energy balance is also studied to find its ability to be self-sufficient when using an existing DPF. Finally, its capability to generate tritium from its lithium blanket is also analyzed. The system is self-sustainable.}
